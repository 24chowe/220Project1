# 220Project1
##### By Colin Howe
When starting this project, I was using decker and Atom as my terminal and editor. Using Atom was my biggest mistake. After making all my commits and attempting my merge, I was met with an error message telling me the automatic merge failed. This was expected, but the issue was that Atom did not give me any prompts to fix this merge. I looked on youtube how to resolve the conflict and discovered an editor called Visual Studio Code used by youtuber “ihatetomatoes”. Once using this editor, things moved smoothly as I was able to accept incoming or current changes in one click of a button. In addition, I found the commands *git status* and *git log*. *git status* allowed me to see if there was any issue with the merging, or if I needed to commit and/or push the current version. *git log* would tell me if the merge worked or not.  The only other issue I had was when I made an edit to the file, then tried *git checkout* to the other branch it would cause errors. I found before you made edits, you needed to be in the branch you wanted to commit to before edits.
